indextext: Bangkok based multidisciplinary designer, proficient in product design, furniture, interior design, installation, lighting objects, sound design. 

project1: With the modern urban living style, the rise of the skyscraper and condominium has been obstructed the air ventilation in the city. This problem has promoted the use of an air conditioner which is an additional pain-cost to people who are living in the urban area. Moreover, the waste of energy is another concern. Generally, low-temperature wind has lower mass than the higher temperature wind, which cause the warm air rises up. The reason why poor ventilation room has higher temperature because warm air accumulate and stuck above the ceiling, without ventilated in the space. So this solution take an advantage of this principle to inhale a low-temperature wind from below, and exhale with a higher position to push a high-temperature wind out of space. To create thermal comfort, this design can automatically and precisely adjust the wind speed appropriately for the room temperature by using a thermal sensor. Beside, not only it is eco  but also provide a natural feeling.

fabricate: This Chandelier inspired by a fluid shape of fabric flowing with the wind, which designed for low ceiling or horizontal space. A fabrication of glass can be infinitely connect according to space.
fabricate2: Inspired from an architecture motive, to create connection between space and object.

wave: A permanent lighting installation. Designed for a hotel and residential named “Shama Lakeview Asoke.” The design intends to reflect a smooth movement and continuity of water wave to welcome a customer to flow inside the space. Each perspective will give a sense of different movement following the point of view. This chandelier has been design to fit in 28sqm. and 3.5 height with sprinkler spreading area confliction avoidance, in an emergency situation this chandelier allowed the sprinkler to work with full efficiency.
wave2: Inspired from a natural but geometric shape which enhance a similarity when seen in different angle
wave3: Rhythm of wave harmoniously move accoding to sprinkler projecting radius between space which be able to safe construsction and engineering cost. 

dp1: A gigantic 120sqm. outdoor chandelier, compile of 1400 individual lights and Italian blown glasses with different shading for Pavilion hotel in Malaysia. This chandelier has been installed at the drop-off of the hotel. The design acting as a lighting and a signage. At the center of the chandelier, the blown glasses were designed dynamically lower than the outer to communicate the designated spot to stop the car.
dp2: Gem stone represent rich and tough at the same time, this component suitable for using semi outdoor for a durability look but still luxury

chair: Invisible is the keyword of the design to make people who is sitting feel like they are sitting on the invisible running water. By the experiment of material process which is plastic extrusion by using PE plastic polyethalene to adjust the temperature which cause the crystal line and air bubbles inside. 

hana: The concept started from the “Increase an efficiency in Bangchaocha village by using product design strategy” Which this village is advanced about Bamboo weaving for over the past 50 years, the majority of the customers are mostly middle-aged Japanese women.The main product is the women purse which its shape is familiar normal shape, so that it has the limitation in selling products because there is no development about new weaving technique. Thus the idea was created to develop people by introducing them new techniques for difficult shape, mold making and design that used two layers of weaving which is rarely seen in Thailand. 

boodwood: The aim of this project is to figuring out the way to instilled value into a souvenir so that a simple act of giving and receiving gift can be ever more meaningful. To many people, it is not far-fetch to say that, non-life products fail to hold their value and, at some point in time, are often left unattended. This leads to the quest in trying to make our products express themselves and create a deeper emotional tie to the product’s owner expression onto our mini tree pots, ones can bring their seemingly lifeless plants to life. And this is the story of a living tress with a funny hairstyle that can express their emotion, waiting for human to nature them with gentle and care. 



fan2: Because of crowded space in urban area, real estate and buildings are trying to optimize space for econmomics reason. All buildings have been designed base on this concern which cause a low efficiency of natural air ventilation usage.
fan3: To create Thermal comfort in living space to reduce energy consumption 
fan4: Thermal comfort are temperature, humidity, wind speed, suitable with human body not too hot, not too cold, no sweat and moist cover the skin doesn’t have too many or too little on water vapour and no aggressive wind blow. 
fan5: Temperature 24 +- 2 Celsius. Humidity 55 +- 5% RH. Wind speed 15-25 ft/min. 2% Co2 in area or 220 ppm 
fan6: In each context there are some specific area and function usage, all the idea has been rationalized positioning, wind speed, wind intensity and temperature according to each space.
fan7: Key idea is to create a better air ventilation by inhaling cold air from below and blow hot air to create a natural ventilation with a lower room temperature.
fan8: This design allow user to calibate the wind direction by pushing the knob and hold to adjust the LED laser on floor. 
fan9: This design will automatically activate and deactivate after ultrasonic sensor has detected human movement in the position. Temperature display with a moving LED bar will activate responsively to room temperature and fin direction to allow user to appreciated the wind direction.

treehouse1: A small wooden house located in the small backyard area of the main house. The tree has a 3 open side and fence at the back of it. the purpose is, to create a space that make can be shared between kids and adult while they are close to nature. There are two completely different parts of a house which seperated function for kids and adults meanwhile there is a connected open court and window that can see through each others. 
room: This living room used to be an urn of family ancestor collected room,which give a sense of formidable and cause an uncomfortable sense to family members to use this room as a daily living function. So "casual " is a main keyword for a design approach to redesign this living room into a contemporary modern casual look which reduce a sense of formidable while keeping urn and photo of their ancestor
diamondpearl: To create a luxurious vibes with a contemporary decorative style by using a diamond patterns apply into a pearl earring shape.
diamondpearl2: A gradually silver look glass drop shape finishing, inspired by a pearl finishing which has a touch of silver but soft with an elegant feeling.
